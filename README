This folder contains the necessary code and test data to reproduce the 
experiments in AAAI 2020 submission #7649, "Finding Most Compatible Phylogenetic 
Trees over Multi-State Characters".

Installing:

1. You need to have CPLEX installed. It is the only component not included in 
this folder.

2. Compile MaxHS. Follow the instructions in MaxHS-3.0/README. We assume that 
the MaxHS binary is located in the default location 
MaxHS-3.0/build/release/bin/maxhs after this.

3. Compile other binaries. Just 'make' in this directory.



Usage:

Example usage of BT-MaxSAT to compute maximum compatibility:

./bt-maxsat/triangulator maxcomp < instances/mammals.phy

You can replace mammals.phy with other instances in the instances directory.
The instances with prefixes ms_exp1_n, ms_exp1_k, ms_exp1_r are used in the 
first set of experiments, and the instances with prefix ms_exp2 are used in the 
second set of experiments. alcataenia, chinese, indo, indo-pp and mammals are 
the real-world benchmarks that we used.


Example usage of PBO to compute maximum compatibility:

./pbo.sh instances/mammals.phy
